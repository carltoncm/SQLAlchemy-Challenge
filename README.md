This repository is for the Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 10 Challenge

I began my analyis by connecting to the SQLite file and importing the information therein. This allowed me to analyze the data and be able to draw conclusions regarding the best time to travel to Hawaii. I was able to explore the relationship between date and percipiation:

Next, I explored the relationship between frequency and temperature in the dataset by analyzing the data provided by the most active station:

These analyses show that Hawaii is a pretty temperate location year-round, but there are periods of heavy rainfall that should be avoided when planning a vacation. The rain appears to be most active in the spring and fall, but there was also some activity reported in July. Summer is generally warmer than the winter months, so it may be best to plan a trip to Hawaii in the summer if you are seeking outdoor activities.

Finally, I created an API using Flask for other users to be able to parse the data and draw their own conclusions!

I referenced class activities and instruction provided by Instructor Brett Barnes and TA Ally Qi to complete this activity.
